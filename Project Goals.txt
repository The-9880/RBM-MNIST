Project Goals:
- Get comfortable constructing custom neural network architectures in
Tensorflow
- Learn to define custom cost functions in Tensorflow
- Be able to implement models and methods described in academic papers
on my own, for my own interest
- Build a RBM and learn a generative model
- Generate reconstructions that are accurate representations
- Achieve something awesome
